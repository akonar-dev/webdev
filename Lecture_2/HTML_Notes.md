### 4.What is meant by boilerplate code?
**Ans.** Boilerplate code refers to sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little or no modification. It's typically required for setting up the foundational structure of an application, project, or specific functionality, but doesn't necessarily relate to the core logic of the program.

Example:
 ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
 ### 5. What are tags in html?
 **Ans.** In HTML, tags are the building blocks used to define and structure elements on a webpage. Tags are written using angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., <tagname>) and a closing tag (e.g., </tagname>), though some tags are self-closing.

 Examples - `<p> <h1></h1>  <  <hr/>  <br/> </p>`

### 6. What is an HTMl element?
**Ans.** An <openingTag> + content + </closingTag> form an html element. It is the basic building block of an html document.

Example - `<p><h1>Content</h1></p>`

### 7. Define meta, link and title tags in HTML.
**Ans.**
 1. `<p><meta></p>`: Defines metadata for the webpage (SEO, responsiveness, character set).
 2. `<p><link></p>`: Links external resources like CSS files and favicons.
 3. `<p><title></p>`: Sets the webpage title shown in browser tabs and improves SEO.

Example -

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Learn about meta, link, and title tags in HTML.">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <title>Understanding Meta, Link, and Title Tags</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Heading Tags in HTML
HTML heading tags are used to define headings in a document. These tags range from '<h1>' to '<h6>', with '<h1>' being the most important or prominent and '<h6>' being the least.

```html
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
<h3>This is a sub-subheading</h3>
<h4>This is a smaller heading</h4>
<h5>This is an even smaller heading</h5>
<h6>This is the smallest heading</h6>
```
